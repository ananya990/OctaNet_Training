# OctaNet_Training

During my internship training at Octanet, I embarked on an enriching journey into the world of web development. Through this program, I gained a comprehensive understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies. My learning experience included mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and visually appealing web pages. Additionally, I delved into modern frameworks and libraries like React and Bootstrap, which enhanced my ability to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

Moreover, I applied my knowledge to complete their tasks and made practical projects and built a responsive Landing Page, and developed a To Do Application. Each project not only reinforced my technical skills but also improved my problem-solving abilities and teamwork.
